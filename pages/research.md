Research in our lab sits at the interface of redox biology, metabolism
and signaling, and focuses on understanding the role of antioxidant
systems in oxidative stress response and cancer therapy resistance. We
combine frontier molecular, genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic
approaches to address these questions. We have interest in the
following areas: 

- Role and regulation of mitochondrial antioxidant system in cancer cells.

- Mitochondria and redox signaling crosstalk in cancer cells.

- Redox vulnerabilities of human malignancies.

- The impact of onco-viral infection (EBV and HPV) on the redox status of cancer cells.
